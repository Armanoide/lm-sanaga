/// A utility struct that bridges a synchronous crossbeam channel (`Receiver<T>`)
/// into an asynchronous stream (`impl Stream<Item = T>`), enabling integration
/// of sync data sources into async contexts.
///
/// This is particularly useful when you have a sync thread (like running in a
/// blocking context or external thread) and need to consume its output using
/// asynchronous streaming interfaces (like with `axum`, or `futures`).
///
/// Internally, this spawns a blocking task using `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`
/// which reads from the sync channel and forwards items to an async `mpsc` channel.
///
/// # Type Parameters
/// - `T`: The item type sent over the channel. Must be `Send + 'static`.
///
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// use crossbeam::channel::bounded;
///
/// let (tx, rx) = bounded::<String>(100);
/// let bridge = TokenBridge::new(rx);
/// let mut stream = bridge.into_stream();
///
/// // `stream` is now an async stream of `String` values
/// ```
